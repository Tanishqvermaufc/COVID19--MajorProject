# COVID19 Outbreak Prediction
COVID19- outbreak prediction using Machine Learning.

This project deals with the trendy topic of coronavirus. The disease is causing severe damage to the entire population as well as to the nationâ€™s economy. Machine Learning algorithms like Linear regression, Support Vector Machines and SIR Model have been used to prepare good and valid predictions of this disease. Total cases, Recovered cases, Infected cases and Deaths reported are there in the project ahead represented beautifully in form of piecharts, bargraphs and line plots.
Predictions are there for next 20 days and we all hope that the cases remain as low as possible and we achieve the peak of the disease as early as possible.
Also it should be made clear that these are not clinically and globally accepted to be true and these should not be used anywhere for the medical basis. This clearly gives us the right approach and a brief idea of how Machine Learning can be used in such pandemic situations.
